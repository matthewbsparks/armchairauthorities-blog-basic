# The Hagiography of Saint Charlie Kirk

The word **hagiography** refers to the biography of a saint, or an idealized telling of someone's biography.

To hear so many Progressive pundits, personalities, and representatives of the left (I'm looking at you, [Ezra Klein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaeoDlLNnok)) concede to describing Kirk as some sort of fallen patron saint of free speech—as if he were one of the last of a dying breed of good faith public debaters, willing to honestly listen and contest all challengers who dared face him in the Thunderdome that was his signature "Change My Mind" booth—has been, frankly, both **sad and deeply disturbing.**

There was a painfully obvious reason that Charlie exclusively debated young, undergraduate college students with little to no debate experience. Kids that were mostly entirely unprepared for the public scrutiny of hundreds of thousands, if not millions (his channel sits at 5.6 *million* YouTube subscribers at the time of writing), rabid Kirk fans online.

**It was all absolutely by design.**

Charlie Kirk wasn't setup on college campuses defending the spirit of good old fashioned, honest debate with level playing field. He wasn't there truly testing his mettle in the "marketplace of ideas" against academia's most capable opponents.

He was there for one reason, and one reason only.

**To own the libs. For content.**

Charlie was there to clip farm as much as possible in order to grow his personal brand and that of Turning Point USA. His "debates"  were often a series of "gotcha" moments--ambushes on the often unsuspecting and usually ill-prepared college kids. The footage then later manipulated by his team of editors to give the impression that Charlie was blazing an undefeated trail across America's woke epicenters, laying waste to everything and everyone he believed were "destroying his country."

**Charlie Kirk's YouTube content was much more "reality TV" than open political debate.** He was playing the main protagonist in his own "brave young conservative saves his nation from the cancerous rot of progressivism" fan-fic.

[Generally, the more educated the populace is, the more likely they become to vote for Democratic candidates](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-by-race-ethnicity-and-education/), so making college campuses the battlegrounds where he took the fight to the "enemy" served the additional common conservative goal of demonizing higher education.

"_Look how worthless this education your kids are getting is! See how easily academia's brainwashing is defeated in true debate with facts and reason!_"

His Turning Point USA tours were more akin to a [Sherman's March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea) of anti-intellectualism—nothing like the [Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858](https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/debates.htm) that would set Lincoln in motion to later become President and **actually** save our Country.

# We Must Stop Forfeiting the Narrative

It is not only possible to *both* condemn the act of horrific violence that took Charlie's life, and to soberly evaluate his undeniably negative impact on our larger political dialogues, **it is an absolute necessity that we do so.

Otherwise, Progressives are simply continuing to do what they've been doing for years: allowing a dishonest rightwing media machine, always in unquestioning lockstep with one another, to control national narratives, entirely unchallenged, with their deeply damaging, radioactive untruths.

**To continue playing their game, in their venues, with their language, is to play a game where there can never be victory.**

Charlie was adept at playing this game: forcing his opponent to accept his framing of issues, use his words, and then corner them into seemingly unwinnable intellectual positions. He had the formula all figured out. Any "debate" that went awry could simply be edited to look otherwise, or removed entirely.

It's why his team made it so difficult for people like Steven Bonnell, known online as Destiny, from entering the arena of debate against Charlie.

# The Real Cancel Culture

In the aftermath of Charlie's murder, the party that has, for years, cried about "cancel culture," and the "death of comedy" is working around the clock, pearl clutching at every opportunity and calling for the silencing of any who dare to seriously examine Charlie Kirk's legacy. What happened with Jimmy Kimmel is simply the most obvious example.

Anyone that dares suggest Charlie was anything other than some sort of Political Christ that died defending our First Amendment rights faces potential career destruction, thousands of death threats and personal attacks online, and much more. Because going against their narrative **hurts their fragile little feelings.**

This entire ordeal, once again, confirms what plenty of us already know:

**The right is made up of the softest snowflakes of all.** Hypocritical, special snowflakes.

Remember when members of the Democratic party were executed in their own homes by a deranged lunatic LARPing as a cop? Silence.

All those innocent children slaughtered at school shooting after school shooting? _Thoughts and prayers._ There was a school shooting _the very same day_ that Charlie was shot, but you'd be forgiven for not knowing that given what little airtime and discussion it received. School shootings have become some regular that they've been relegated to uninteresting news of little consequence.

What a fucked up world this Trump Party has created.

# Make THEM Call For Lowering of Temperatures

Never willing to let a tragedy go to waste when it could be instead spun into motivation for hate, the **Trump Party** has done everything in its power to raise the temperature on the political climate. The President, himself, seems as if he would rather cut off one of his own (really tiny) hands than even _hint_ that toning down the violent rhetoric might be a good idea.

They've done nothing since Charlie's murder but speak of "enemies", stir hate among their base, and pound the drums of war for an upcoming fight against "them."

The event they held in Kirk's honor dedicated much more time to demonizing an "enemy," looking for any way possible to vaguely blame "the left," and singing the praises of their **white** heritage (God, how I wish that were a joke), rather than doing any sort of mourning.

# Where Does the Violence ACTUALLY Come From?

The truth always has a habit of getting in the way of the Trump Party's narratives (not that that's EVER stopped them).

We know beyond and certainty that the vast majority of political violence is committed by right ring extremists in this country. Yet the Trump Party seemed to display exactly **zero** interest in calming things down. Instead, they want to pick enemies, manufacture demons, and prepare the Trump Cult for their holy war against the half of the nation Trump has spent years teaching people to hate unconditionally.

And what has the party that is so against "cancel culture" and so concerned about the "banning of comedy" done?

The President of the United States used his authority to have a late night show host taken off air. They want those that do not consider Charlie a hero to be considered potential domestic terrorists, so that they can be easily catalogued, and possibly even rounded up in the future.

Their response has been to try to cancel any and everyone that might so much as utter a shred of critical examination of the Charlie Kirk's life's work.

This country is being run by a legion of **snowflake authoritarians.** But I guess all authoritarians, historically speaking, have been a bit of snowflakes, haven't they?

# Refuse to Kneel

Do not let them threaten and frighten you into silence. While their side is entirely unbound by the facts of reality, or by any shred of human decency, I still hold an unshakable faith that the average American is not like the people that spoke at and attended that Kirk rally.

Trump's approval ratings continue to drop. His tariffs, which he continues to simply make up on up on a week-to-week basis, depending on whom he spoke with last or wounded his fragile ego most recently, are wreaking havoc on supply chains and American businesses.

The American people don't like it when the President can strong arm a broadcasting company into firing show hosts.

Though it seems an eternity from now, mid terms will come, and **they. will. lose.**

They will do everything to cry election fraud, disenfranchise voters, make it impossible to vote, but we must remain committed to handicapping this authoritarian regime and its sycophantic cult in every way that we can.

Every nightmare is eventually awoken from.

Even ones is as long as this one.
