# Republicans Are Quiet Quitting MAGA Over Epstein

**The Epstein files are going to be released. We've got the votes.**

Despite establishment Democrats being the dick-on-a-fish version of an opposition party, the release of the Epstein files may very well be Teflon Donald's Kryptonite.

And, despite his recent, predictable efforts and dismissals, 77% of Americans want the files released with the victim's names redacted. ([Source](https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-1st-amendment-in-the-u-s-october-2025/))

Much more shockingly, recent polling showed that **27%** of Republicans would consider **VOTING FOR ANOTHER PARTY** if Trump was **implicated** in the Epstein files. No, not stop supporting the Trump Party. *Vote for an entirely different party.*

On the opposite end of the surprise spectrum, 47% of Republicans still say that don't give a shit if Trump is implicated in child sex trafficking, and 26% just aren't *real sure* if they're quite ready to take the stand and bravely affirm, "*child sex crimes bad!*"

I mean, Republicans *did* say that "moral leadership" just really ain't that important of a quality for the leader of the free world. So, that kinda checks out.

Trump once famously said:
>"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any votes, OK? It's, like, incredible."

    <figcaption>This didn't turn out to be entirely inaccurate of an assessment.</figcaption>

At the time, that seemed, like, some incredibly *wild shit* for someone running for President of the United States to say. Today, those words seem depressingly clairvoyant. After he fired the shot, he'd just have to suggest the guy might have been "one bad hombre", have Kash Patel slap a "*I'm in el gang*" tattoo in Microsoft Paint on the man's body, and call it a day.

Or just say that the entire thing was some elaborate scheme Biden somehow clandestinely engineered, despite their adamance of his "sleepy" state.

Normally, that's all his people need.

**But something about this Epstein stuff is different**.

Despite Trump having managed to pretty much successfully deflect and downplay every single other scandal since escalator day (or E-Day), even though just *one or a couple of these* likely would've been enough to completely end other previous administrations, **why does it feel the Epstein connection could be Trump's Kryptonite**?

To really understand why an administration that has seemed, quite literally, "scandal-proof," now appears so vulnerable and ready to fracture, we need to first understand what exactly a "scandal" is in today's world, who these Republicans are that care so much about the Epstein Files, and how they and other Republicans have been conditioned to think as members of the new Trump Party.

## Teflon Donald's Kryptonite: Anatomy of a Political Scandal

Why would you need to define what a **scandal** is in terms of a US president? It's one of those "*you know it when you see it*" things, isn't it?

Well, I think that depends entirely on who you ask, obviously. If you ask anyone on the left and what Trump's political scandals were, you'd likely hear: ***nearly fucking everything*** since he took office again. They likely wouldn't know where to begin, and, honestly, we here at AA would struggle similarly.

And we're not gonna waste time torturing us all by trying to list every single Trump scandal, because not in the business of making 10-plus hour videos. And we don't hate ourselves _that much_.

But the cold, hard truth of today is that virtually **NONE** of the answers you or I might have given are things that Trump voters consider "*scandals*".

You know what used to be a political scandal to Republicans, flying close to "Chat GPT has become self-aware and launched all the nukes" in terms of seriousness?

**Obama wearing a tan suit.**

Sorry for the lack of a trigger warning before bringing that political trauma up.

I was a Young Republican during the Obama years, and you wouldn't believe how deadly serious people were when they talked about how much of a "disgrace" that tan suit was to the image of our country's leader.

**Michelle Obama trying to get healthier meals for kids in public schools** was another, seemingly world-ending political freakout for the Right back then.

Ironic, considering their support for the shit RFK and his trusted sidekick/pet, Mr. Brainworm, have been saying, eh?

Regardless, let's get a bit more literal for a moment.

What defines a **political scandal**?

Combining definitions from Wikipedia and researchers at the University of Chicago, we get something like:

>A **political scandal** occurs when wrongdoing by a political figure or institution becomes public knowledge, usually sparking some degree of outrage because of a betrayal of expectations, principles, promises, etc. It's about broken trust between leaders and citizens, not JUST the mistake itself.

Although the Obama era examples I used were picked, in part, to demonstrate the extreme change in expectations and responses for what constitutes political scandal, let's revisit them for a moment with our Republican thinking caps (safety helmets) on and some historical context.

The **tan suit** was a political scandal because Republicans believed it to be unbecoming of the President to deviate from standard dress protocol to a degree that was too "loud" to them. Like if your heart surgeon showed up in a banana hammock and crocs: you'd be *concerned.*

Michelle Obama's **school lunch** program, to Republicans, was an example of the nanny state reaching into the lives of their children, and deciding what they could and could not be served for lunch. One of the many things that was pounded into my head as a young Republican growing up was that just about any attempt by the federal government to create good through ANY expansion of government was inherently dumb, immoral, and doomed to fail.

**However, a lot has changed since those Obama years.** For all of us. But, least of all, for the Republican Party that I grew up inside. I'll save the deep dive about what I learned, and how I changed my beliefs, for another video. (*if you're interested, comment below*)

Republican outrage over a Republican political scandal would require some betrayal of principles, trust, or expectations. (Despite how it seems, apparently they do still have some principles remaining) The foundational principles of the Republican party were made abundantly clear to me growing up. Let's use a few of them now in a mental exercise to see if we can demonstrate some important observations.

- Utmost respect towards all members of the armed services, and nearly unwavering support for military engagements

I think John McCain, his family, and every Ukrainian citizen can attest that those just aren't important anymore. Or John Kerry, who can tell you that this has never really been true.

- Restricting the powers and shrinking of the federal government and its powers whenever and wherever possible

DEFINITELY not a concern. The power of the presidency has never been expanded so explosively and so rapidly, and Trump has replaced as many offices as possible with loyal yes-men. Look up Unitary Executive Theory if you want to learn more

- An emphasis on Christian morality and conservative Christian beliefs

Isn't our President the "grab 'em by the pussy" guy? That's been accused of sexual misconduct by _at least_ 27 women? Who was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation against E. Jean Carroll? Who cheated on his wife with a porn star, and then tried to illegally pay her off?

Not only has Jesus left the picture, they've painted an entirely new one: Trump IS their new Jesus.

- Unrestrained capitalism is the greatest engine for good in the modern world, and our economic policies should be centered around that ideal

You know what isn't very capitalist? Or in anyway supported by modern economists? Tariffs and protectionist trade policies. They know, as many of us do, that the only people that end up paying for tariffs are American consumers. We've _already_ got research from Trump's first go round proving that (**source needed**).

So if Trump voters don't care about the massive expansion of the Trump admin's power, his obviously extreme anti-Christian-like behavior, his anti-free-market-capitalist-policies, his mocking of war heroes, or anything else the Republican party claimed to care about, you can begin to understand why he seems to be, in many ways, **scandal-proof.**

To the Trump Party, there haven't really been any scandals. And because Trump seemed to maintain strong support from the Republican base, all the Republican politicians took advantage of their unique biology of having been born without anything one might consider a spine, and simply began shaping their platforms to be whatever Trump was saying at any given moment. _Which could be wide range of wild, different, and often self-conflicting shit_.

**So what DO they care about?**

## MAGA & QAnon
### The Unironically Most Principled Part of Trump's Base

Ironically, it would be impossible to nail down foundational principles of the MAGA movement by listening to its leader, Trump, because of his constant lying, flip flopping, and general habit of nonsensical word diarrhea.

So, instead, we shall turn to some of the poor suckers that have been forced to carve some out in order to have anything resembling a platform and philosophy to provide to their base. People like Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, the late Charlie Kirk, and my completely brainwashed extended family from the deep south.

Because we love you, dear viewer, oh so much, we won't make you sit through all the Bannon podcasts or Tucker Carlson events necessary to parse any of this out. MAGA's foundational pillars, if it was to have any, can be boiled down to this:

# Indira's Additions to Add to the Above Sections

### National Populist
-  Clip of Bannon saying that Trump ran against the conservative party because they were all corrupt Necons
- The Party of Reagan, of traditional conservativism, of small governments states rights, free markets, yada, yada is GONE.
- The new Trump MAGA party is a National Populist/Christian Nationalist Party, that has maintained some of the aesthetics of the Reagan and the Neocons, but in substance is completely different.
- See Bannon for explanation
-  So the reason it seems as if they don't care about what they used to care about is because they are literally a different party with different values--National Populist.

## Scandals

Usually what happens is either they don't care about the "scandal" and express approval of it

They don't actually know what happened because it is never reported under the Republican Propaganda Machine -- like the crypto scams

If everyone is aware of the scandal, the republican propaganda machine uses the mental gymnastics of the narcissists playbook to get out of it -- like downplaying what happened on January 6, so they end up not knowing the full or true story
## Campaign

**PussyGate**

- Republican Leadership, like Mitt Romney cared, but the people excused it. In fact, some men found his candor refreshing as it reminded them of how they speak behind closed doors, since "telling it like it is" is a part of Trump's brand, to some PussyGate made him more, not less, trustworthy

**Tax Evasion**

Trump broke decades of precedent by refusing to voluntarily release his tax returns during his campaign by claiming he was under audit and there was "nothing to learn" from them.  Conservative commentators echoed this sentiment, framing Democrats "obsession" as a partisan attack and media "witch hunt." Ultimately, it wouldn't have mattered what his returns showed, as according to Trump, not paying taxes "makes me smart"-- a sentiment echoed by Matthew's father. While, Democrats believe rich people should pay their fair share, to Republicans "taxation is theft;" Tax avoidance isn't you cheating the system, as the system has already cheated you. To them, Trump didn't abdicate his civic duty, he is simply doing what they would do, if they had the chance. Eventually, in December 2022, after a lengthy congressional battle, House Ways and Means made his federal returns for 2015-2020 public. By reporting large business losses, among other schemes, his returns showed he paid very little to none at all---as Democrats suspected.

- If being forced to pay taxes is the state's "original sin," then tax avoidance is an admirable form of "vigilante justice."
- They live vicariously through his vigilante justice, setting the stage for him to be their "retribution"
