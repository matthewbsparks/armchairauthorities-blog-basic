# Republicans Are Quiet Quitting MAGA Over Epstein

**The Epstein files are going to be released. We've got the votes.**

Despite establishment Democrats being the dick-on-a-fish version of an opposition party, the release of the Epstein files may very well be Teflon Donald's Kryptonite.

And, despite his recent, predictable efforts and dismissals, 77% of Americans want the files released with the victim's names redacted. ([Source](https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-1st-amendment-in-the-u-s-october-2025/))

Much more shockingly, recent polling showed that **27%** of Republicans would consider **VOTING FOR ANOTHER PARTY** if Trump was **implicated** in the Epstein files. No, not stop supporting the Trump Party. *Vote for an entirely different party.*

On the opposite end of the surprise spectrum, 47% of Republicans still say that don't give a shit if Trump is implicated in child sex trafficking, and 26% just aren't *real sure* if they're quite ready to take the stand and bravely affirm, "*child sex crimes bad!*"

I mean, Republicans *did* say that "moral leadership" just really ain't that important of a quality for the leader of the free world. So, that kinda checks out.

Trump once famously said:
>"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any votes, OK? It's, like, incredible."

At the time, that seemed, like, some incredibly *wild shit* for someone running for President of the United States to say. Today, those words seem depressingly clairvoyant. After he fired the shot, he'd just have to suggest the guy might have been "one bad hombre", have Kash Patel slap a "*I'm in el gang*" tattoo in Microsoft Paint on the man's body, and call it a day.

Or just say that the entire thing was some elaborate scheme Biden somehow clandestinely engineered, despite their adamance of his "sleepy" state.

Normally, that's all his people need.

**But something about this Epstein stuff is different**.

Despite Trump having managed to pretty much successfully deflect and downplay every single other scandal since escalator day (or E-Day), even though just *one or a couple of these* likely would've been enough to completely end other previous administrations, **why does it feel the Epstein connection could be Trump's Kryptonite**?

To really understand why an administration that has seemed, quite literally, "scandal-proof," now appears so vulnerable and ready to fracture, we need to first understand what exactly a "scandal" is in today's world, who these Republicans are that care so much about the Epstein Files, and how they and other Republicans have been conditioned to think as members of the new Trump Party.

## Teflon Donald's Kryptonite: Anatomy of a Political Scandal

Why would you need to define what a **scandal** is in the terms of a US president? It's one of those "*you know it when you see it*" things, isn't it?

Well, I think that depends entirely on who you ask. If you ask anyone on the left, the answer would be: ***nearly fucking everything*** that's happened since Trump took office for the second time, and that's ignoring everything from the first administration.

I won't waste time torturing us all by trying to list every single Trump scandal, plus I'm not in the business of making 10-plus hour videos.

But the cold, hard truth of the present is that virtually **NONE** of the answers you and I might have given are things that Trump voters consider "*scandals*".

You know what used to be a political scandal to Republicans, flying close to "Chat GPT has become self-aware and launched all the nukes" in terms of seriousness?

**Obama wearing a tan suit.**

Sorry for the lack of a trigger warning before bringing that political trauma up.

I was a Young Republican during the Obama years, and you wouldn't believe how deadly serious people were when they talked about how much of a "disgrace" that tan suit was to the "status of the presidential office."

**Michelle Obama trying to get healthier meals for kids in public schools** was another, seemingly world-ending political freakout for the Right back then.

Ironic, considering their support for the shit RFK and his trusted sidekick, Mr. Brainworm, have been saying, eh?

Anywho, let's get a bit more literal for a moment.
