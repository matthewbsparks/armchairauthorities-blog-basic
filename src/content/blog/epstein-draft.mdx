# Intro

**The Epstein files are going to be released. They have the votes.**

Despite Democrats best efforts to render us all hopeless and demonstrate the political effectiveness of a dick on a fish, the release of the Epstein Files will be Teflon Don's Kryptonite.

77% of Americans want the files released with the victim's names redacted. ([Source](https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-1st-amendment-in-the-u-s-october-2025/))

Recent polling showed that **27%** of Republicans would consider **VOTING FOR ANOTHER PARTY** if Trump was implicated in the Epstein files. No, not stop supporting the Trump Party--VOTE FOR AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTY.

To the surprise of literally no one, 47% of Republicans say they don't care if Trump is implicated in child sex trafficking, and 26% just aren't *real sure* if they're ready to die on the hill of child sex trafficking being bad.

I mean, they *did* say that moral leadership just really ain't that important of a quality for the leader of the Free world!

Trump once said:
>"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any votes, OK? It's, like, incredible."

At the time, that seemed like some absolutely wild shit for someone running for President of the United States to say. Today, all he'd have to say was that the guy might have been "one bad hombre/illegal," have Kash Patel draw "*I'm in el gang*" in Microsoft Paint on the image, and call it day.

**But something about this Epstein stuff is different**.

Why does it feel like it could be Trump's Kryptonite, despite him having deflected virtually every single other scandal - many of which could have ended most administrations?

To really understand why an administration that has seemed, quite literally, "scandal-proof," now appears so vulnerable and ready to fracture, we need to understand what exactly a "scandal" is, who these Republicans are that care so much about the Epstein connection, and how they and other Republicans have been conditioned to think.

Stick with us, and we'll show you just how truly different and potentially game changing this could be for our political landscape.

# Teflon Don's Kryptonite: Anatomy of a Scandal

What constitutes a **scandal** in politics, particularly with presidents, can vary wildly depending on who is in office. Let's take Obama for an example, a "scandal", considered borderline apocalyptic by the right, was when he wore a tan suit.

Hard to believe we're still a country after that, honestly, yet, miraculously, here we stand (for now.)

Things have been a different under the Trump administrations. What exactly does a _Trump scandal_ look like?

To us on the left: ***FUCKING EVERYTHING.***
