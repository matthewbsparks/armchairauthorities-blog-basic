# "Personal Knowledge Management Systems"

>“Sometimes you’re doing good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.” - Stephen King

As more and more of the world has migrated into the digital realm for note keeping, writing, project management, and all sorts of knowledge management, the sheer quantity of applications available for "personal knowledge management" (PKM apps) has absolutely exploded. The number of hours that I've sunk, cumulatively, into extensively trial-running many of these applications would shock even myself. And I'm likely better off just not know its true total.

At some point, I was forced to simply admit to myself that, while I was getting very little *actually accomplished* by reorganizing my personal notes, and designing new systems of categorization, for the n-th time, I was, indeed **having fun**. The moment I admitted to myself that I was simply enjoying a new, albeit unusual, **hobby**--rather than on the verge of unlocking productivity on the level of Bradley Cooper in *Limitless*, I became, ironically, much more capable of objectively analyzing the usefulness of each of these applications and the solutions they offered.

Here at **Armchair Authorities**, we like to learn, and we have a lot of varying interests and hobbies. We're constantly cataloging important news articles and academic papers, drafting scripts for video essays, consuming *way too much* YouTube content, managing personal and professional projects, and diving deeper into our own personal hobbies. Organizing all this information, and attempting to extract useful information from it all, can require quite a bit of effort. To get a better handle on this all, years ago I started looking into apps that might make all this a bit easier.

# Phase 1: The Casual Apps

At "level one"--if you will--there's your standard office suite apps like **Microsoft Word**, **Google Docs**, and similar apps. The kind you're likely to see being used by your average undergraduate student. If you're just trying to jot some regular notes, save the files in your `/Documents/` folder (or **OneDrive**, if Microsoft has bamboozled you with their refusal to give up forcing you into their cloud environment), these apps will serve you just fine.

However, what happens if you start becoming overwhelmed by the sheer number of files?

And what if you've got different kinds of files, serving difference kinds of purposes?

Your personal commentary piece on a *particularly* infuriating *New York Times* article should probably live in a difference space than your document for collecting new recipes for your diet. Not only should they be saved in different placed, but they should likely be formatted differently. Maybe even retrieved differently.

What if you wanted a way to tag documents you've written that all cover a similar subject, so that you might later use them like Lego pieces to assemble a much larger, more conclusive written piece on the subject?

What if you find yourself working on multiple devices, some of which don't have the exact software you need to open the file properly if it were, say, a `.docx` file from Microsoft Word.

Say, what if you wanted to label all your research files related to a certain project in a way that allows you to pull them all up easily by search or query?

Now, you're looking for both a **categorization system** of some sort, and **filetype that can be edited by a longer list of writing apps.**

Some cursory internet search teaches you about **Markdown** (`.md`) files, which have their own "language" for creating links, making headings, boldening text, etc. There's a still learning curve, but now you'll have the super power of bi-directionally linking notes! Much like how links on a Wiki article can link to other articles, while also still being clearly linked back to the originating note.

You're now entering . . .

# Phase 2: Enter Knowledge Management

**[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** is likely the first app you'll be recommended to to take your knowledge management to the next level. It's totally free. All the notes are saved as markdown files, which are super portable. Notes can be bi-directionally linked to one another simply by referencing the titles of other files with double square brackets like so: `[[Other Note]]`. The more and more your similar notes become linked, the more you see your "knowledge graph" start to connect.

You even begin to hear whispers of something mythical called "**emergent knowledge**" as a result of all your hard work learning and linking your knowledge together so effectively! Novel thoughts, ideas, and connections *erupting* through your synapses that would have never been known to you had you not invested in your knowledge management so! Your materials for your projects are more organized than ever before, and though your folder hierachies have expanded to meet the growing quantity of markdown files in your Obsidian vault, they're still manageable!

Despite all this, you **know** there's more you could be doing with Obsidian. You finally decide to venture into the settings menu and click:

<div class="centered-btn-container">
  <span class="fake-btn">Turn on community plugins</span>
</div>

**An entire new world has now opened to you.**

You can put a calendar widget in the corner, and clicking on each date will open a new note for that day? *Now you could really commit to daily journaling like you've been meaning to!*

You can add a plugin that will track all your tasks, across every note, and query them from anywhere in your vault? It even supports due dates, recurring tasks, and filtering?!

Even better than a list of tasks, you could simply **install a Kanban board**, and get the satisfaction of click-and-dragging all those to-do items into the **Completed** section of the board!

Also, *have you tried changing your theme yet?* There are a TON of incredible looking custom themes to turn your minimalist looking Markdown editor into something truly exotic or exciting! People spent a *lot* of time customizing all that `.css`, you might as well just *take a look, right?*

**You see where this is all going?**

It doesn't take much for your Obsidian vault to resemble some sort of Frankenstein's monster of community plugins, custom stylizing rules, various folder and tag organizational theories, dozens of half started projects . . .

**What happened?**
