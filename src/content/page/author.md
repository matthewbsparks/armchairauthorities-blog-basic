# Armchair Authorities

Welcome to the Armchair Authorities (AA) knowledge base. This is where we collect, organize, and share our research, findings, opinions, arguments, works in progress, content we create, and more.

## Who Are We?

We're a progressive, interracial, American couple that come from backgrounds the average person might consider a bit wild, but we think that gives us a bit of uniqueness and edge, and we hope that shows in our content. For our own safety in our professional lives, our early work will likely just be voice narration—at least until we can be sure that we create won't negatively impact our personal and profession lives. At least one of us is already quite easy to find online for reasons completely unrelated to any of the kind of content you'll see on here (props to anyone that recognizes me voice).

## Our Content

**Our content will primarily be YouTube video essays focused on American politics**, though we could certainly branch out from there. What's the point of having the status of an armchair authority if you don't exercise it by speaking on every subject you can, right?

On a more serious note, we hold ourselves to a high standard when it comes to what we release publicly. Long-form content will be thoroughly researched, edited, re-editing, scrapped at least once, and previewed to those we trust before it ever sees the light of the day.

Smaller ideas, thoughts that come to us, and bit sized nuggets of info we find useful or important may end up being posted as a **Spark** over on the **Sparks** page of the website. Think of it as our own personal Twitter, without, you know, everything that makes Twitter terrible—AKA 99% of Twitter.

We have plans on writing about our methods and tools, as well, at some point. That sort of info could end up as written pieces or as videos. We really don't know yet. We're figuring this all out as we go (I''m literally teaching myself to program as we go just to make sure this website gets made and functions). The same goes for video production.

Music in videos, when possible and appropriate, will also be done by yours truly.

If you can't tell, we like to do things ourselves when we can, likely to a fault.
