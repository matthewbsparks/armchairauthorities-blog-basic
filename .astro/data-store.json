Kids that were mostly entirely unprepared for the public scrutiny of hundreds of thousands, if not millions (his channel sits at 5.6 *million* YouTube subscribers at the time of writing), rabid Kirk fans online.\r\n\r\n**It was all absolutely by design.**\r\n\r\nCharlie Kirk wasn't setup on college campuses defending the spirit of good old fashioned, honest debate with level playing field. He wasn't there truly testing his mettle in the \"marketplace of ideas\" against academia's most capable opponents.\r\n\r\nHe was there for one reason, and one reason only.\r\n\r\n**To own the libs. For content.**\r\n\r\nCharlie was there to clip farm as much as possible in order to grow his personal brand and that of Turning Point USA. His \"debates\"  were often a series of \"gotcha\" moments--ambushes on the often unsuspecting and usually ill-prepared college kids. The footage then later manipulated by his team of editors to give the impression that Charlie was blazing an undefeated trail across America's woke epicenters, laying waste to everything and everyone he believed were \"destroying his country.\"\r\n\r\n**Charlie Kirk's YouTube content was much more \"reality TV\" than open political debate.** He was playing the main protagonist in his own \"brave young conservative saves his nation from the cancerous rot of progressivism\" fan-fic.\r\n\r\n[Generally, the more educated the populace is, the more likely they become to vote for Democratic candidates](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-by-race-ethnicity-and-education/), so making college campuses the battlegrounds where he took the fight to the \"enemy\" served the additional common conservative goal of demonizing higher education.\r\n\r\n\"_Look how worthless this education your kids are getting is!

He had the formula all figured out. Any \"debate\" that went awry could simply be edited to look otherwise, or removed entirely.\r\n\r\nIt's why his team made it so difficult for people like Steven Bonnell, known online as Destiny, from entering the arena of debate against Charlie.\r\n\r\n# The Real Cancel Culture\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of Charlie's murder, the party that has, for years, cried about \"cancel culture,\" and the \"death of comedy\" is working around the clock, pearl clutching at every opportunity and calling for the silencing of any who dare to seriously examine Charlie Kirk's legacy. What happened with Jimmy Kimmel is simply the most obvious example.\r\n\r\nAnyone that dares suggest Charlie was anything other than some sort of Political Christ that died defending our First Amendment rights faces potential career destruction, thousands of death threats and personal attacks online, and much more. Because going against their narrative **hurts their fragile little feelings.**\r\n\r\nThis entire ordeal, once again, confirms what plenty of us already know:\r\n\r\n**The right is made up of the softest snowflakes of all.** Hypocritical, special snowflakes.\r\n\r\nRemember when members of the Democratic party were executed in their own homes by a deranged lunatic LARPing as a cop?

The President, himself, seems as if he would rather cut off one of his own (really tiny) hands than even _hint_ that toning down the violent rhetoric might be a good idea.\r\n\r\nThey've done nothing since Charlie's murder but speak of \"enemies\", stir hate among their base, and pound the drums of war for an upcoming fight against \"them.\"\r\n\r\nThe event they held in Kirk's honor dedicated much more time to demonizing an \"enemy,\" looking for any way possible to vaguely blame \"the left,\" and singing the praises of their **white** heritage (God, how I wish that were a joke), rather than doing any sort of mourning.\r\n\r\n# Where Does the Violence ACTUALLY Come From?\r\n\r\nThe truth always has a habit of getting in the way of the Trump Party's narratives (not that that's EVER stopped them).\r\n\r\nWe know beyond and certainty that the vast majority of political violence is committed by right ring extremists in this country. Yet the Trump Party seemed to display exactly **zero** interest in calming things down. Instead, they want to pick enemies, manufacture demons, and prepare the Trump Cult for their holy war against the half of the nation Trump has spent years teaching people to hate unconditionally.\r\n\r\nAnd what has the party that is so against \"cancel culture\" and so concerned about the \"banning of comedy\" done?\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States used his authority to have a late night show host taken off air. They want those that do not consider Charlie a hero to be considered potential domestic terrorists, so that they can be easily catalogued, and possibly even rounded up in the future.\r\n\r\nTheir response has been to try to cancel any and everyone that might so much as utter a shred of critical examination of the Charlie Kirk's life's work.\r\n\r\nThis country is being run by a legion of **snowflake authoritarians.** But I guess all authoritarians, historically speaking, have been a bit of snowflakes, haven't they?\r\n\r\n# Refuse to Kneel\r\n\r\nDo not let them threaten and frighten you into silence.
