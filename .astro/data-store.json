It’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God given rights. That’s a prudent deal. It is rational . . . ” - **Charlie Kirk**\r\n\r\nThe word **hagiography** refers to the biography of a saint, or an idealized telling of someone's biography.\r\n\r\nTo hear so many Progressive pundits, personalities, and representatives of the left (I'm looking at you, [Ezra Klein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaeoDlLNnok)) concede to describing Kirk as some sort of fallen patron saint of free speech—as if he were one of the last of a dying breed of good faith public debaters, willing to honestly listen and contest all challengers who dared face him in the Thunderdome that was his signature \"Change My Mind\" booth—has been, frankly, both **sad and deeply disturbing.**\r\n\r\nThere was a painfully obvious reason that Charlie exclusively debated young, undergraduate college students with little to no debate experience. Kids that were mostly entirely unprepared for the public scrutiny of hundreds of thousands, if not millions (his channel sits at 5.6 *million* YouTube subscribers at the time of writing), rabid Kirk fans online.\r\n\r\n**It was all absolutely by design.**\r\n\r\nCharlie Kirk wasn't setup on college campuses defending the spirit of good old fashioned, honest debate with level playing field. He wasn't there truly testing his mettle in the \"marketplace of ideas\" against academia's most capable opponents.\r\n\r\nHe was there for one reason, and one reason only.\r\n\r\n**To own the libs. For content.**\r\n\r\nCharlie was there to clip farm as much as possible in order to grow his personal brand and that of Turning Point USA. His \"debates\"  were often a series of \"gotcha\" moments--ambushes on the often unsuspecting and usually ill-prepared college kids. The footage then later manipulated by his team of editors to give the impression that Charlie was blazing an undefeated trail across America's woke epicenters, laying waste to everything and everyone he believed were \"destroying his country.\"\r\n\r\n**Charlie Kirk's YouTube content was much more \"reality TV\" than open political debate.** He was playing the main protagonist in his own \"brave young conservative saves his nation from the cancerous rot of progressivism\" fan-fic.\r\n\r\n[Generally, the more educated the populace is, the more likely they become to vote for Democratic candidates](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-by-race-ethnicity-and-education/), so making college campuses the battlegrounds where he took the fight to the \"enemy\" served the additional common conservative goal of demonizing higher education.\r\n\r\n\"_Look how worthless this education your kids are getting is! See how easily academia's brainwashing is defeated in true debate with facts and reason!_\"\r\n\r\nHis Turning Point USA tours were more akin to a [Sherman's March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea) of anti-intellectualism—nothing like the [Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858](https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/debates.htm) that would set Lincoln in motion to later become President and **actually** save our Country.\r\n\r\n# We Must Stop Forfeiting the Narrative\r\n\r\nIt is not only possible to *both* condemn the act of horrific violence that took Charlie's life, and to soberly evaluate his undeniably negative impact on our larger political dialogues, **it is an absolute necessity that we do so.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, Progressives are simply continuing to do what they've been doing for years: allowing a dishonest rightwing media machine, always in unquestioning lockstep with one another, to control national narratives, entirely unchallenged, with their deeply damaging, radioactive untruths.\r\n\r\n**To continue playing their game, in their venues, with their language, is to play a game where there can never be victory.**\r\n\r\nCharlie was adept at playing this game: forcing his opponent to accept his framing of issues, use his words, and then corner them into seemingly unwinnable intellectual positions. He had the formula all figured out. Any \"debate\" that went awry could simply be edited to look otherwise, or removed entirely.\r\n\r\nIt's why his team made it so difficult for people like Steven Bonnell, known online as Destiny, from entering the arena of debate against Charlie.\r\n\r\n# The Real Cancel Culture\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of Charlie's murder, the party that has, for years, cried about \"cancel culture,\" and the \"death of comedy\" is working around the clock, pearl clutching at every opportunity and calling for the silencing of any who dare to seriously examine Charlie Kirk's legacy. What happened with Jimmy Kimmel is simply the most obvious example.\r\n\r\nAnyone that dares suggest Charlie was anything other than some sort of Political Christ that died defending our First Amendment rights faces potential career destruction, thousands of death threats and personal attacks online, and much more. Because going against their narrative **hurts their fragile little feelings.**\r\n\r\nThis entire ordeal, once again, confirms what plenty of us already know:\r\n\r\n**The right is made up of the softest snowflakes of all.** Hypocritical, special snowflakes.\r\n\r\nRemember when members of the Democratic party were executed in their own homes by a deranged lunatic LARPing as a cop? Silence.\r\n\r\nAll those innocent children slaughtered at school shooting after school shooting? _Thoughts and prayers._ There was a school shooting _the very same day_ that Charlie was shot, but you'd be forgiven for not knowing that given what little airtime and discussion it received. School shootings have become some regular that they've been relegated to uninteresting news of little consequence.\r\n\r\nWhat a fucked up world this Trump Party has created.\r\n\r\n# Make THEM Call For Lowering of Temperatures\r\n\r\nNever willing to let a tragedy go to waste when it could be instead spun into motivation for hate, the **Trump Party** has done everything in its power to raise the temperature on the political climate. The President, himself, seems as if he would rather cut off one of his own (really tiny) hands than even _hint_ that toning down the violent rhetoric might be a good idea.\r\n\r\nThey've done nothing since Charlie's murder but speak of \"enemies\", stir hate among their base, and pound the drums of war for an upcoming fight against \"them.\"\r\n\r\nThe event they held in Kirk's honor dedicated much more time to demonizing an \"enemy,\" looking for any way possible to vaguely blame \"the left,\" and singing the praises of their **white** heritage (God, how I wish that were a joke), rather than doing any sort of mourning.\r\n\r\n# Where Does the Violence ACTUALLY Come From?\r\n\r\nThe truth always has a habit of getting in the way of the Trump Party's narratives (not that that's EVER stopped them).\r\n\r\nWe know beyond and certainty that the vast majority of political violence is committed by right ring extremists in this country. Yet the Trump Party seemed to display exactly **zero** interest in calming things down. Instead, they want to pick enemies, manufacture demons, and prepare the Trump Cult for their holy war against the half of the nation Trump has spent years teaching people to hate unconditionally.\r\n\r\nAnd what has the party that is so against \"cancel culture\" and so concerned about the \"banning of comedy\" done?\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States used his authority to have a late night show host taken off air. They want those that do not consider Charlie a hero to be considered potential domestic terrorists, so that they can be easily catalogued, and possibly even rounded up in the future.\r\n\r\nTheir response has been to try to cancel any and everyone that might so much as utter a shred of critical examination of the Charlie Kirk's life's work.\r\n\r\nThis country is being run by a legion of **snowflake authoritarians.** But I guess all authoritarians, historically speaking, have been a bit of snowflakes, haven't they?\r\n\r\n# Refuse to Kneel\r\n\r\nDo not let them threaten and frighten you into silence. While their side is entirely unbound by the facts of reality, or by any shred of human decency, I still hold an unshakable faith that the average American is not like the people that spoke at and attended that Kirk rally.\r\n\r\nTrump's approval ratings continue to drop. His tariffs, which he continues to simply make up on up on a week-to-week basis, depending on whom he spoke with last or wounded his fragile ego most recently, are wreaking havoc on supply chains and American businesses.\r\n\r\nThe American people don't like it when the President can strong arm a broadcasting company into firing show hosts.\r\n\r\nThough it seems an eternity from now, mid terms will come, and **they. will. lose.**\r\n\r\nThey will do everything to cry election fraud, disenfranchise voters, make it impossible to vote, but we must remain committed to handicapping this authoritarian regime and its sycophantic cult in every way that we can.\r\n\r\nEvery nightmare is eventually awoken from.\r\n\r\nEven ones is as long as this one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n- [Ta-Nehisi Coates and Ezra Klein Hash Out Their Charlie Kirk Disagreement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaeoDlLNnok)\r\n\r\n- [PEW: Partisanship by race, ethnicity and education](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-by-race-ethnicity-and-education/)\r\n\r\n- [Wikipedia: Sherman's March to the Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea)\r\n\r\n- [NPS: The Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858](https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/debates.htm)","src/content/blog/hagiography-ck.mdx","fa7ad643867ce482",true,"epstein-vs-maga",{"id":27,"data":29,"body":40,"filePath":41,"digest":42,"deferredRender":26},{"title":30,"description":31,"image":32,"pubDate":33,"tags":34},"COMING SOON: Our First Video Essay!","It's about Trump, Epstein, and the Trump Party!","/images/epstein.jpg",["Date","2025-10-20T00:00:00.000Z"],[35,36,37,38,39],"Epstein","Trump","MAGA","Conspiracy","YouTube","import \"../../styles/mdx-styling.css\";\r\n\r\n# After Over Half a Decade: Our First Video\r\n\r\n>“Terrific guy \\[Epstein]... likes beautiful women ... many of them are on the younger side.” - **Donald J. Trump**\r\n\r\n**Armchair Authorities** was a concept I came up with back in 2019. I needed a YouTube channel name that was broad enough that it would allow me to create video content on just about anything that I wanted, yet still indicated, even if only a minor way, that I don't take myself more seriously than I should--that I'm aware of the limitations of my own knowledge, credentials, and experience.\r\n\r\nThat does not mean, however, that our essays will not be **relentlessly** researched, edited, poured over, rewritten, edited some more.. You get the idea.\r\n\r\nI wanted the slogan for the channel to be: **Armchair Authorities: half the credentials, all of the research.**\r\n\r\nThe quality and accuracy of our video essay work is something we both take extremely seriously, especially when choosing to tackle such important, complex, and nuanced topics. We may only be armchair authorities, but we will absolutey push our armchair capabilites to their limits.\r\n\r\n**The first video is an examination of the limits of devotion displayed by members of Trump Party, particularly the more conpiracy-minded ones, and the impact of this whole Epstein debacle on them.**\r\n\r\n**We can't wait to show it to you.**\r\n\r\n# Why Armchair Authorities?\r\n\r\nI'm kind of a weird person, and I have a lot of very different hobbies and interests.\r\n\r\nI've played music my entire life, though listen to and play mostly metal, have a neuroscience degree and previously worked in addiction treatment, went to law school for a bit before dropping out because I hated it, used to be a devout conservative Republican while growing up in the deep south, love video games and tech, have a connective tissue disorder that impacts my quality of life and has been the reason for numerous reconstrutive surgeries, am impacted by college football on a deep, emotional level . . . the list could go on and on.\r\n\r\nMy significant other--the other half of Armchair Authorities--is at least as weird as I am, and it's fucking awesome.\r\n\r\nWe also both be obsessive and perfectionists in ways that aren't always super productive. It's no coincidence that it's taken us at least 5 years to finally put out a video essay, despite the hundreds of ideas and partially written scripts from over the years.\r\n\r\nWe had **A LOT** of \"real life shit\" happen and get in the way. We had a lot of failed starts that we ultimately decided weren't good enough. That a video essay is being uploaded at all is a small miracle all on its own.\r\n\r\nBur what if we don't want to always talk about politics?\r\n\r\nI don't know about y'all, but that shit can get pretty depressing. And somtimes it's fun to just go on and on about things you're excited about. My partner loves film, and has extremely well developed tastes in that domain. What if we wanted to write a film review next? Followed by a video on every personal knowledge management and task tracking app that I've tested for unreasonable numbers of hours? Or a video on the neuroscience of addiction?\r\n\r\nIf we didn't establish the freedom to make videos on whichever topics we thought were either most important or most interesting, this whole Armchair Authorities thing might have been snuffed out in the womb.","src/content/blog/epstein-vs-maga.mdx","d4151e9e0b0eefeb","content-workflow",{"id":43,"data":45,"body":56,"filePath":57,"digest":58,"deferredRender":26},{"title":46,"description":47,"image":48,"pubDate":49,"tags":50},"The Esteemed Art of Pseudoproductivity, Part I","You wouldn't believe how much work I can do without doing any work.","/images/TangentPanes.jpg",["Date","2025-10-19T00:00:00.000Z"],[51,52,53,54,55],"ADHD","Productivity","Knowledge Management","Content Creation","Workflow","import \"../../styles/mdx-styling.css\";\r\n\r\n# \"Personal Knowledge Management Systems\"\r\n\r\n>“Sometimes you’re doing good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.” - Stephen King\r\n\r\nAs more and more of the world has migrated into the digital realm for note keeping, writing, project management, and all sorts of knowledge management, the sheer quantity of applications available for \"personal knowledge management\" (PKM apps) has absolutely exploded. The number of hours that I've sunk, cumulatively, into extensively trial-running many of these applications would shock even myself. And I'm likely better off just not know its true total.\r\n\r\nAt some point, I was forced to simply admit to myself that, while I was getting very little *actually accomplished* by reorganizing my personal notes, and designing new systems of categorization, for the n-th time, I was, indeed **having fun**. The moment I admitted to myself that I was simply enjoying a new, albeit unusual, **hobby**--rather than on the verge of unlocking productivity on the level of Bradley Cooper in *Limitless*, I became, ironically, much more capable of objectively analyzing the usefulness of each of these applications and the solutions they offered.\r\n\r\nHere at **Armchair Authorities**, we like to learn, and we have a lot of varying interests and hobbies. We're constantly cataloging important news articles and academic papers, drafting scripts for video essays, consuming *way too much* YouTube content, managing personal and professional projects, and diving deeper into our own personal hobbies. Organizing all this information, and attempting to extract useful information from it all, can require quite a bit of effort. To get a better handle on this all, years ago I started looking into apps that might make all this a bit easier.\r\n\r\n# Phase 1: The Casual Apps\r\n\r\nAt \"level one\"--if you will--there's your standard office suite apps like **Microsoft Word**, **Google Docs**, and similar apps. The kind you're likely to see being used by your average undergraduate student. If you're just trying to jot some regular notes, save the files in your `/Documents/` folder (or **OneDrive**, if Microsoft has bamboozled you with their refusal to give up forcing you into their cloud environment), these apps will serve you just fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, what happens if you start becoming overwhelmed by the sheer number of files?\r\n\r\nAnd what if you've got different kinds of files, serving difference kinds of purposes?\r\n\r\nYour personal commentary piece on a *particularly* infuriating *New York Times* article should probably live in a difference space than your document for collecting new recipes for your diet. Not only should they be saved in different placed, but they should likely be formatted differently. Maybe even retrieved differently.\r\n\r\nWhat if you wanted a way to tag documents you've written that all cover a similar subject, so that you might later use them like Lego pieces to assemble a much larger, more conclusive written piece on the subject?\r\n\r\nWhat if you find yourself working on multiple devices, some of which don't have the exact software you need to open the file properly if it were, say, a `.docx` file from Microsoft Word.\r\n\r\nSay, what if you wanted to label all your research files related to a certain project in a way that allows you to pull them all up easily by search or query?\r\n\r\nNow, you're looking for both a **categorization system** of some sort, and **filetype that can be edited by a longer list of writing apps.**\r\n\r\nSome cursory internet search teaches you about **Markdown** (`.md`) files, which have their own \"language\" for creating links, making headings, boldening text, etc. There's a still learning curve, but now you'll have the super power of bi-directionally linking notes! Much like how links on a Wiki article can link to other articles, while also still being clearly linked back to the originating note.\r\n\r\nYou're now entering . . .\r\n\r\n# Phase 2: Enter Knowledge Management\r\n\r\n**[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** is likely the first app you'll be recommended to to take your knowledge management to the next level. It's totally free. All the notes are saved as markdown files, which are super portable. Notes can be bi-directionally linked to one another simply by referencing the titles of other files with double square brackets like so: `[[Other Note]]`. The more and more your similar notes become linked, the more you see your \"knowledge graph\" start to connect.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n    \u003Cimg src=\"/images/ObsidianGraph.jpg\" alt=\"knowledge graph\" className=\"obsidian-img\" />\r\n    \u003Cfigcaption>A knowledge graph of Obsidan nodes (notes).\u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nYou even begin to hear whispers of something mythical called \"**emergent knowledge**\" as a result of all your hard work learning and linking your knowledge together so effectively! Novel thoughts, ideas, and connections *erupting* through your synapses that would have never been known to you had you not invested in your knowledge management so! Your materials for your projects are more organized than ever before, and though your folder hierachies have expanded to meet the growing quantity of markdown files in your Obsidian vault, they're still manageable!\r\n\r\nDespite all this, you **know** there's more you could be doing with Obsidian. You finally decide to venture into the settings menu and click:\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv class=\"centered-btn-container\">\r\n  \u003Cspan class=\"fake-btn\">Turn on community plugins\u003C/span>\r\n\u003C/div>\r\n\r\n**An entire new world has now opened to you.**\r\n\r\nYou can put a calendar widget in the corner, and clicking on each date will open a new note for that day? *Now you could really commit to daily journaling like you've been meaning to!*\r\n\r\nYou can add a plugin that will track all your tasks, across every note, and query them from anywhere in your vault? It even supports due dates, recurring tasks, and filtering?!\r\n\r\nEven better than a list of tasks, you could simply **install a Kanban board**, and get the satisfaction of click-and-dragging all those to-do items into the **Completed** section of the board!\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n    \u003Cimg src=\"/images/ObsidianGraph2.jpg\" alt=\"Plugin Store\" className=\"obsidian-img\" />\r\n    \u003Cfigcaption>The Obsidian community plugin market.\u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nAlso, *have you tried changing your theme yet?* There are a TON of incredible looking custom themes to turn your minimalist looking Markdown editor into something truly exotic or exciting! People spent a *lot* of time customizing all that `.css`, you might as well just *take a look, right?*\r\n\r\n**You see where this is all going?**\r\n\r\nIt doesn't take much for your Obsidian vault to resemble some sort of Frankenstein's monster of community plugins, custom stylizing rules, various folder and tag organizational theories, dozens of half started projects . . .\r\n\r\n**What happened?**","src/content/blog/content-workflow.mdx","1d5f914f076061ba","page",["Map",61,62],"author",{"id":61,"data":63,"body":67,"filePath":68,"digest":69,"deferredRender":26},{"title":64,"description":65,"image":66},"Who Are We?","Learn about who we are and what we do","/images/protestDC.jpg","import \"../../styles/mdx-styling.css\";\r\n\r\n# Armchair Authorities\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Armchair Authorities (AA) knowledge base.

For our own safety in our professional lives, our early work will likely just be voice narration—at least until we can be sure that we create won't negatively impact our personal and profession lives. At least one of us is already quite easy to find online for reasons completely unrelated to any of the kind of content you'll see on here (props to anyone that recognizes me voice).\r\n\r\n## Our Content\r\n\r\n**Our content will primarily be YouTube video essays focused on American politics**, though we could certainly branch out from there. What's the point of having the status of an armchair authority if you don't exercise it by speaking on every subject you can, right?\r\n\r\nOn a more serious note, we hold ourselves to a high standard when it comes to what we release publicly. Long-form content will be thoroughly researched, edited, re-editing, scrapped at least once, and previewed to those we trust before it ever sees the light of the day.\r\n\r\nSmaller ideas, thoughts that come to us, and bit sized nuggets of info we find useful or important may end up being posted as a **Spark** over on the **Sparks** page of the website. Think of it as our own personal Twitter, without, you know, everything that makes Twitter terrible—AKA 99% of Twitter.\r\n\r\nWe have plans on writing about our methods and tools, as well, at some point. That sort of info could end up as written pieces or as videos. We really don't know yet. We're figuring this all out as we go (I''m literally teaching myself to program as we go just to make sure this website gets made and functions). The same goes for video production.\r\n\r\nMusic in videos, when possible and appropriate, will also be done by yours truly.\r\n\r\nIf you can't tell, we like to do things ourselves when we can, likely to a fault.","src/content/page/author.mdx","bf61efea1032ca70"]
