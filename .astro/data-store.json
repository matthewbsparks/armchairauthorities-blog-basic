It’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God given rights. That’s a prudent deal. It is rational . . . ” - **Charlie Kirk**\r\n\r\nThe word **hagiography** refers to the biography of a saint, or an idealized telling of someone's biography.\r\n\r\nTo hear so many Progressive pundits, personalities, and representatives of the left (I'm looking at you, [Ezra Klein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaeoDlLNnok)) concede to describing Kirk as some sort of fallen patron saint of free speech—as if he were one of the last of a dying breed of good faith public debaters, willing to honestly listen and contest all challengers who dared face him in the Thunderdome that was his signature \"Change My Mind\" booth—has been, frankly, both **sad and deeply disturbing.**\r\n\r\nThere was a painfully obvious reason that Charlie exclusively debated young, undergraduate college students with little to no debate experience. Kids that were mostly entirely unprepared for the public scrutiny of hundreds of thousands, if not millions (his channel sits at 5.6 *million* YouTube subscribers at the time of writing), rabid Kirk fans online.\r\n\r\n**It was all absolutely by design.**\r\n\r\nCharlie Kirk wasn't setup on college campuses defending the spirit of good old fashioned, honest debate with level playing field. He wasn't there truly testing his mettle in the \"marketplace of ideas\" against academia's most capable opponents.\r\n\r\nHe was there for one reason, and one reason only.\r\n\r\n**To own the libs. For content.**\r\n\r\nCharlie was there to clip farm as much as possible in order to grow his personal brand and that of Turning Point USA. His \"debates\"  were often a series of \"gotcha\" moments--ambushes on the often unsuspecting and usually ill-prepared college kids. The footage then later manipulated by his team of editors to give the impression that Charlie was blazing an undefeated trail across America's woke epicenters, laying waste to everything and everyone he believed were \"destroying his country.\"\r\n\r\n**Charlie Kirk's YouTube content was much more \"reality TV\" than open political debate.** He was playing the main protagonist in his own \"brave young conservative saves his nation from the cancerous rot of progressivism\" fan-fic.\r\n\r\n[Generally, the more educated the populace is, the more likely they become to vote for Democratic candidates](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-by-race-ethnicity-and-education/), so making college campuses the battlegrounds where he took the fight to the \"enemy\" served the additional common conservative goal of demonizing higher education.\r\n\r\n\"_Look how worthless this education your kids are getting is! See how easily academia's brainwashing is defeated in true debate with facts and reason!_\"\r\n\r\nHis Turning Point USA tours were more akin to a [Sherman's March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea) of anti-intellectualism—nothing like the [Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858](https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/debates.htm) that would set Lincoln in motion to later become President and **actually** save our Country.\r\n\r\n# We Must Stop Forfeiting the Narrative\r\n\r\nIt is not only possible to *both* condemn the act of horrific violence that took Charlie's life, and to soberly evaluate his undeniably negative impact on our larger political dialogues, **it is an absolute necessity that we do so.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, Progressives are simply continuing to do what they've been doing for years: allowing a dishonest rightwing media machine, always in unquestioning lockstep with one another, to control national narratives, entirely unchallenged, with their deeply damaging, radioactive untruths.\r\n\r\n**To continue playing their game, in their venues, with their language, is to play a game where there can never be victory.**\r\n\r\nCharlie was adept at playing this game: forcing his opponent to accept his framing of issues, use his words, and then corner them into seemingly unwinnable intellectual positions. He had the formula all figured out. Any \"debate\" that went awry could simply be edited to look otherwise, or removed entirely.\r\n\r\nIt's why his team made it so difficult for people like Steven Bonnell, known online as Destiny, from entering the arena of debate against Charlie.\r\n\r\n# The Real Cancel Culture\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of Charlie's murder, the party that has, for years, cried about \"cancel culture,\" and the \"death of comedy\" is working around the clock, pearl clutching at every opportunity and calling for the silencing of any who dare to seriously examine Charlie Kirk's legacy. What happened with Jimmy Kimmel is simply the most obvious example.\r\n\r\nAnyone that dares suggest Charlie was anything other than some sort of Political Christ that died defending our First Amendment rights faces potential career destruction, thousands of death threats and personal attacks online, and much more. Because going against their narrative **hurts their fragile little feelings.**\r\n\r\nThis entire ordeal, once again, confirms what plenty of us already know:\r\n\r\n**The right is made up of the softest snowflakes of all.** Hypocritical, special snowflakes.\r\n\r\nRemember when members of the Democratic party were executed in their own homes by a deranged lunatic LARPing as a cop? Silence.\r\n\r\nAll those innocent children slaughtered at school shooting after school shooting? _Thoughts and prayers._ There was a school shooting _the very same day_ that Charlie was shot, but you'd be forgiven for not knowing that given what little airtime and discussion it received. School shootings have become some regular that they've been relegated to uninteresting news of little consequence.\r\n\r\nWhat a fucked up world this Trump Party has created.\r\n\r\n# Make THEM Call For Lowering of Temperatures\r\n\r\nNever willing to let a tragedy go to waste when it could be instead spun into motivation for hate, the **Trump Party** has done everything in its power to raise the temperature on the political climate. The President, himself, seems as if he would rather cut off one of his own (really tiny) hands than even _hint_ that toning down the violent rhetoric might be a good idea.\r\n\r\nThey've done nothing since Charlie's murder but speak of \"enemies\", stir hate among their base, and pound the drums of war for an upcoming fight against \"them.\"\r\n\r\nThe event they held in Kirk's honor dedicated much more time to demonizing an \"enemy,\" looking for any way possible to vaguely blame \"the left,\" and singing the praises of their **white** heritage (God, how I wish that were a joke), rather than doing any sort of mourning.\r\n\r\n# Where Does the Violence ACTUALLY Come From?\r\n\r\nThe truth always has a habit of getting in the way of the Trump Party's narratives (not that that's EVER stopped them).\r\n\r\nWe know beyond and certainty that the vast majority of political violence is committed by right ring extremists in this country. Yet the Trump Party seemed to display exactly **zero** interest in calming things down. Instead, they want to pick enemies, manufacture demons, and prepare the Trump Cult for their holy war against the half of the nation Trump has spent years teaching people to hate unconditionally.\r\n\r\nAnd what has the party that is so against \"cancel culture\" and so concerned about the \"banning of comedy\" done?\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States used his authority to have a late night show host taken off air. They want those that do not consider Charlie a hero to be considered potential domestic terrorists, so that they can be easily catalogued, and possibly even rounded up in the future.\r\n\r\nTheir response has been to try to cancel any and everyone that might so much as utter a shred of critical examination of the Charlie Kirk's life's work.\r\n\r\nThis country is being run by a legion of **snowflake authoritarians.** But I guess all authoritarians, historically speaking, have been a bit of snowflakes, haven't they?\r\n\r\n# Refuse to Kneel\r\n\r\nDo not let them threaten and frighten you into silence. While their side is entirely unbound by the facts of reality, or by any shred of human decency, I still hold an unshakable faith that the average American is not like the people that spoke at and attended that Kirk rally.\r\n\r\nTrump's approval ratings continue to drop. His tariffs, which he continues to simply make up on up on a week-to-week basis, depending on whom he spoke with last or wounded his fragile ego most recently, are wreaking havoc on supply chains and American businesses.\r\n\r\nThe American people don't like it when the President can strong arm a broadcasting company into firing show hosts.\r\n\r\nThough it seems an eternity from now, mid terms will come, and **they. will. lose.**\r\n\r\nThey will do everything to cry election fraud, disenfranchise voters, make it impossible to vote, but we must remain committed to handicapping this authoritarian regime and its sycophantic cult in every way that we can.\r\n\r\nEvery nightmare is eventually awoken from.\r\n\r\nEven ones is as long as this one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n- [Ta-Nehisi Coates and Ezra Klein Hash Out Their Charlie Kirk Disagreement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaeoDlLNnok)\r\n\r\n- [PEW: Partisanship by race, ethnicity and education](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-by-race-ethnicity-and-education/)\r\n\r\n- [Wikipedia: Sherman's March to the Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea)\r\n\r\n- [NPS: The Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858](https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/debates.htm)","src/content/blog/hagiography-ck.mdx","fa7ad643867ce482",true,"content-workflow",{"id":27,"data":29,"body":40,"filePath":41,"digest":42,"deferredRender":26},{"title":30,"description":31,"image":32,"pubDate":33,"tags":34},"The Esteemed Art of Pseudoproductivity, Part I","You wouldn't believe how much work I can do without doing any work.","/images/TangentPanes.jpg",["Date","2025-10-19T00:00:00.000Z"],[35,36,37,38,39],"ADHD","Productivity","Knowledge Management","Content Creation","Workflow","import \"../../styles/mdx-styling.css\";\r\n\r\n# The Esteemed Art of Pseudoproductivity, Part I\r\n\r\n>“Sometimes you’re doing good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.” - Stephen King\r\n\r\n## \"Personal Knowledge Management Systems\"\r\n\r\nAs more and more of the world has migrated into the digital realm for note keeping, writing, project management, and all sorts of knowledge management, the sheer quantity of applications available for \"personal knowledge management\" (PKM apps) has absolutely exploded. The number of hours that I've sunk, cumulatively, into extensively trial-running many of these applications would shock even myself. And I'm likely better off just not knowing its true total.\r\n\r\nAt some point, I was forced to simply admit to myself that, while I was getting very little *actually accomplished* by reorganizing my personal notes, and designing new systems of categorization, for the n-th time, I was, indeed **having fun**. The moment I admitted to myself that I was simply enjoying a new, albeit unusual, **hobby**--rather than on the verge of unlocking productivity on the level of Bradley Cooper in *Limitless*, I became, ironically, much more capable of objectively analyzing the usefulness of each of these applications and the solutions they offered.\r\n\r\nHere at **Armchair Authorities**, we like to learn, and we have a lot of varying interests and hobbies. We're constantly cataloging important news articles and academic papers, drafting scripts for video essays, consuming *way too much* YouTube content, managing personal and professional projects, and diving deeper into our own personal hobbies. Organizing all this information, and attempting to extract the elusive \"emergent knowledge\" from it all, can require quite a bit of effort. To get a better handle on this all, years ago I started looking into apps that might make all this a bit easier.\r\n\r\n## Phase 1: The Casual Apps\r\n\r\nAt \"level one\"--if you will--there's your standard office suite software like **Microsoft Word**, **Google Docs**, and similar apps. The kind you're likely to see being used by your average undergraduate student or office worker. If you're just trying to jot some regular notes, save the files in your `/Documents/` folder (or **OneDrive**, if Microsoft has bamboozled you with their refusal to give up trying to force or trick you into their cloud environment), these apps will serve you just fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, what happens if you start becoming overwhelmed by the sheer number of files?\r\n\r\nAnd what if you've got different kinds of files, serving difference kinds of purposes?\r\n\r\nYour personal commentary piece on a *particularly* infuriating *New York Times* article should probably live in a difference space than your document for collecting new recipes for your diet (Which *always* starts tomorrow). Not only should they be saved in different placed, but they should likely be formatted differently.\r\n\r\nWhat if you wanted a way to tag documents you've written that all cover a similar subject, so that you might later use them like Lego pieces to assemble a much larger, more conclusive written piece on the subject?\r\n\r\nWhat if you find yourself working on multiple devices, some of which don't have the exact software you need to open the file properly if it were, say, a `.docx` file from Microsoft Word.\r\n\r\nSay, what if you wanted to label all your research files related to a certain project in a way that allows you to pull them all up easily by search or query?\r\n\r\nNow, you're looking for both a **categorization system** of some sort, and **filetype that can be edited by a longer list of writing apps.**\r\n\r\nSome cursory internet research teaches you about **Markdown** (`.md`) files, which have their own \"language\" for creating links, making headings, boldening text, etc. There's a still learning curve, but now you'll have the super power of bi-directionally linking notes! Much like how links on a Wiki article can link to other articles, while also still being clearly linked back to the originating note. (All of these posts are written in a special kind of Markdown!)\r\n\r\nYou're now entering:\r\n\r\n## Phase 2: Enter Knowledge Management\r\n\r\n**[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** is likely the first app you'll be recommended to to take your knowledge management to the next level. It's totally **free** (though *not* open source, contrary to popular perpection)! All the notes are saved as markdown files, which are super portable. Notes can be bi-directionally linked to one another simply by referencing the titles of other files with double square brackets like so: `[[Other Note]]`. The more and more your similar notes become linked, the more you see your \"knowledge graph\" start to connect.\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n    \u003Cimg src=\"/images/ObsidianGraph.jpg\" alt=\"knowledge graph\" className=\"obsidian-img\" />\r\n    \u003Cfigcaption>A knowledge graph of Obsidan nodes (notes).\u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\nYou even begin to hear whispers of something mythical called \"**emergent knowledge**\" as a result of all your hard work learning and linking your knowledge together so effectively!

Trump**\r\n\r\n**Armchair Authorities** was a concept I came up with back in 2019. I needed a YouTube channel name that was broad enough that it would allow me to create video content on just about anything that I wanted, yet still indicated, even if only a minor way, that I don't take myself more seriously than I should--that I'm aware of the limitations of my own knowledge, credentials, and experience.\r\n\r\nThat does not mean, however, that our essays will not be **relentlessly** researched, edited, poured over, rewritten, edited some more.. You get the idea.\r\n\r\nI wanted the slogan for the channel to be: **Armchair Authorities: half the credentials, all of the research.**\r\n\r\nThe quality and accuracy of our video essay work is something we both take extremely seriously, especially when choosing to tackle such important, complex, and nuanced topics. We may only be armchair authorities, but we will absolutey push our armchair capabilites to their limits.\r\n\r\n**The first video is an examination of the limits of devotion displayed by members of Trump Party, particularly the more conpiracy-minded ones, and the impact of this whole Epstein debacle on them.**\r\n\r\n**We can't wait to show it to you.**\r\n\r\n# Why Armchair Authorities?\r\n\r\nI'm kind of a weird person, and I have a lot of very different hobbies and interests.\r\n\r\nI've played music my entire life, though listen to and play mostly metal, have a neuroscience degree and previously worked in addiction treatment, went to law school for a bit before dropping out because I hated it, used to be a devout conservative Republican while growing up in the deep south, love video games and tech, have a connective tissue disorder that impacts my quality of life and has been the reason for numerous reconstrutive surgeries, am impacted by college football on a deep, emotional level . . . the list could go on and on.\r\n\r\nMy significant other--the other half of Armchair Authorities--is at least as weird as I am, and it's fucking awesome.\r\n\r\nWe also both be obsessive and perfectionists in ways that aren't always super productive. It's no coincidence that it's taken us at least 5 years to finally put out a video essay, despite the hundreds of ideas and partially written scripts from over the years.\r\n\r\nWe had **A LOT** of \"real life shit\" happen and get in the way. We had a lot of failed starts that we ultimately decided weren't good enough. That a video essay is being uploaded at all is a small miracle all on its own.\r\n\r\nBur what if we don't want to always talk about politics?\r\n\r\nI don't know about y'all, but that shit can get pretty depressing. And somtimes it's fun to just go on and on about things you're excited about. My partner loves film, and has extremely well developed tastes in that domain. What if we wanted to write a film review next? Followed by a video on every personal knowledge management and task tracking app that I've tested for unreasonable numbers of hours? Or a video on the neuroscience of addiction?\r\n\r\nIf we didn't establish the freedom to make videos on whichever topics we thought were either most important or most interesting, this whole Armchair Authorities thing might have been snuffed out in the womb.","src/content/blog/epstein-vs-maga.mdx","d4151e9e0b0eefeb","epstein-draft",{"id":59,"data":61,"body":66,"filePath":67,"digest":68,"deferredRender":26},{"title":62,"description":63,"image":48,"pubDate":64,"tags":65},"DRAFT: Republicans Are Quiet Quitting MAGA Over Epstein","Is Trump no longer scandal-proof?",["Date","2025-10-24T00:00:00.000Z"],[51,52,53,54,55],"import \"../../styles/mdx-styling.css\";\r\n\r\n# Republicans Are Quiet Quitting MAGA Over Epstein\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n    \u003Cimg src=\"/images/EPSTEIN-SpecialElection.png\" alt=\"Special election related to Epstein\" class=\"img-large\" />\r\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Democrats win Arizona Special Election.\u003C/figcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\n**The Epstein files are going to be released.

It's one of those \"*you know it when you see it*\" things, isn't it?\r\n\r\nWell, I think that depends entirely on who you ask, obviously. If you ask anyone on the left and what Trump's political scandals were, you'd likely hear: ***nearly fucking everything*** since he took office again. They likely wouldn't know where to begin, and, honestly, we here at AA would struggle similarly.\r\n\r\nAnd we're not gonna waste time torturing us all by trying to list every single Trump scandal, because not in the business of making 10-plus hour videos. And we don't hate ourselves _that much_.\r\n\r\nBut the cold, hard truth of today is that virtually **NONE** of the answers you or I might have given are things that Trump voters consider \"*scandals*\".\r\n\r\nYou know what used to be a political scandal to Republicans, flying close to \"Chat GPT has become self-aware and launched all the nukes\" in terms of seriousness?\r\n\r\n**Obama wearing a tan suit.**\r\n\r\nSorry for the lack of a trigger warning before bringing that political trauma up.\r\n\r\nI was a Young Republican during the Obama years, and you wouldn't believe how deadly serious people were when they talked about how much of a \"disgrace\" that tan suit was to the image of our country's leader.\r\n\r\n**Michelle Obama trying to get healthier meals for kids in public schools** was another, seemingly world-ending political freakout for the Right back then.\r\n\r\nIronic, considering their support for the shit RFK and his trusted sidekick/pet, Mr. Brainworm, have been saying, eh?\r\n\r\nRegardless, let's get a bit more literal for a moment.\r\n\r\nWhat defines a **political scandal**?\r\n\r\nCombining definitions from Wikipedia and researchers at the University of Chicago, we get something like:\r\n\r\n>A **political scandal** occurs when wrongdoing by a political figure or institution becomes public knowledge, usually sparking some degree of outrage because of a betrayal of expectations, principles, promises, etc. It's about broken trust between leaders and citizens, not JUST the mistake itself.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Obama era examples I used were picked, in part, to demonstrate the extreme change in expectations and responses for what constitutes political scandal, let's revisit them for a moment with our Republican thinking caps (safety helmets) on and some historical context.\r\n\r\nThe **tan suit** was a political scandal because Republicans believed it to be unbecoming of the President to deviate from standard dress protocol to a degree that was too \"loud\" to them. Like if your heart surgeon showed up in a banana hammock and crocs: you'd be *concerned.*\r\n\r\nMichelle Obama's **school lunch** program, to Republicans, was an example of the nanny state reaching into the lives of their children, and deciding what they could and could not be served for lunch. One of the many things that was pounded into my head as a young Republican growing up was that just about any attempt by the federal government to create good through ANY expansion of government was inherently dumb, immoral, and doomed to fail.\r\n\r\n**However, a lot has changed since those Obama years.** For all of us. But, least of all, for the Republican Party that I grew up inside. I'll save the deep dive about what I learned, and how I changed my beliefs, for another video. (*if you're interested, comment below*)\r\n\r\nRepublican outrage over a Republican political scandal would require some betrayal of principles, trust, or expectations. (Despite how it seems, apparently they do still have some principles remaining) The foundational principles of the Republican party were made abundantly clear to me growing up. Let's use a few of them now in a mental exercise to see if we can demonstrate some important observations.\r\n\r\n- Utmost respect towards all members of the armed services, and nearly unwavering support for military engagements\r\n\r\nI think John McCain, his family, and every Ukrainian citizen can attest that those just aren't important anymore. Or John Kerry, who can tell you that this has never really been true.\r\n\r\n- Restricting the powers and shrinking of the federal government and its powers whenever and wherever possible\r\n\r\nDEFINITELY not a concern. The power of the presidency has never been expanded so explosively and so rapidly, and Trump has replaced as many offices as possible with loyal yes-men. Look up Unitary Executive Theory if you want to learn more\r\n\r\n- An emphasis on Christian morality and conservative Christian beliefs\r\n\r\nIsn't our President the \"grab 'em by the pussy\" guy? That's been accused of sexual misconduct by _at least_ 27 women? Who was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation against E. Jean Carroll? Who cheated on his wife with a porn star, and then tried to illegally pay her off?\r\n\r\nNot only has Jesus left the picture, they've painted an entirely new one: Trump IS their new Jesus.\r\n\r\n- Unrestrained capitalism is the greatest engine for good in the modern world, and our economic policies should be centered around that ideal\r\n\r\nYou know what isn't very capitalist? Or in anyway supported by modern economists? Tariffs and protectionist trade policies. They know, as many of us do, that the only people that end up paying for tariffs are American consumers. We've _already_ got research from Trump's first go round proving that (**source needed**).\r\n\r\nSo if Trump voters don't care about the massive expansion of the Trump admin's power, his obviously extreme anti-Christian-like behavior, his anti-free-market-capitalist-policies, his mocking of war heroes, or anything else the Republican party claimed to care about, you can begin to understand why he seems to be, in many ways, **scandal-proof.**\r\n\r\nTo the Trump Party, there haven't really been any scandals. And because Trump seemed to maintain strong support from the Republican base, all the Republican politicians took advantage of their unique biology of having been born without anything one might consider a spine, and simply began shaping their platforms to be whatever Trump was saying at any given moment. _Which could be wide range of wild, different, and often self-conflicting shit_.\r\n\r\n**So what DO they care about?**\r\n\r\n## MAGA & QAnon\r\n### The Unironically Most Principled Part of Trump's Base\r\n\r\nIronically, it would be impossible to nail down foundational principles of the MAGA movement by listening to its leader, Trump, because of his constant lying, flip flopping, and general habit of nonsensical word diarrhea.\r\n\r\nSo, instead, we shall turn to some of the poor suckers that have been forced to carve some out in order to have anything resembling a platform and philosophy to provide to their base. People like Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, the late Charlie Kirk, and my completely brainwashed extended family from the deep south.\r\n\r\nBecause we love you, dear viewer, oh so much, we won't make you sit through all the Bannon podcasts or Tucker Carlson events necessary to parse any of this out. MAGA's foundational pillars, if it was to have any, can be boiled down to this:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Indira's Additions to Add to the Above Sections\r\n\r\n### National Populist\r\n-  Clip of Bannon saying that Trump ran against the conservative party because they were all corrupt Necons\r\n- The Party of Reagan, of traditional conservativism, of small governments states rights, free markets, yada, yada is GONE.\r\n- The new Trump MAGA party is a National Populist/Christian Nationalist Party, that has maintained some of the aesthetics of the Reagan and the Neocons, but in substance is completely different.\r\n- See Bannon for explanation\r\n-  So the reason it seems as if they don't care about what they used to care about is because they are literally a different party with different values--National Populist.\r\n\r\n## Scandals\r\n\r\nUsually what happens is either they don't care about the \"scandal\" and express approval of it\r\n\r\nThey don't actually know what happened because it is never reported under the Republican Propaganda Machine -- like the crypto scams\r\n\r\nIf everyone is aware of the scandal, the republican propaganda machine uses the mental gymnastics of the narcissists playbook to get out of it -- like downplaying what happened on January 6, so they end up not knowing the full or true story\r\n## Campaign\r\n\r\n**PussyGate**\r\n\r\n- Republican Leadership, like Mitt Romney cared, but the people excused it. In fact, some men found his candor refreshing as it reminded them of how they speak behind closed doors, since \"telling it like it is\" is a part of Trump's brand, to some PussyGate made him more, not less, trustworthy\r\n\r\n**Tax Evasion**\r\n\r\nTrump broke decades of precedent by refusing to voluntarily release his tax returns during his campaign by claiming he was under audit and there was \"nothing to learn\" from them.  Conservative commentators echoed this sentiment, framing Democrats \"obsession\" as a partisan attack and media \"witch hunt.\" Ultimately, it wouldn't have mattered what his returns showed, as according to Trump, not paying taxes \"makes me smart\"-- a sentiment echoed by Matthew's father. While, Democrats believe rich people should pay their fair share, to Republicans \"taxation is theft;\" Tax avoidance isn't you cheating the system, as the system has already cheated you. To them, Trump didn't abdicate his civic duty, he is simply doing what they would do, if they had the chance. Eventually, in December 2022, after a lengthy congressional battle, House Ways and Means made his federal returns for 2015-2020 public. By reporting large business losses, among other schemes, his returns showed he paid very little to none at all---as Democrats suspected.\r\n\r\n- If being forced to pay taxes is the state's \"original sin,\" then tax avoidance is an admirable form of \"vigilante justice.\"\r\n- They live vicariously through his vigilante justice, setting the stage for him to be their \"retribution\"","src/content/blog/epstein-draft.mdx","408ee167ec5d598f","page",["Map",71,72],"author",{"id":71,"data":73,"body":77,"filePath":78,"digest":79,"deferredRender":26},{"title":74,"description":75,"image":76},"Who Are We?","Learn about who we are and what we do","/images/protestDC.jpg","import \"../../styles/mdx-styling.css\";\r\n\r\n# Armchair Authorities\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Armchair Authorities (AA) knowledge base. This is where we collect, organize, and share our research, findings, opinions, arguments, works in progress, content we create, and more.\r\n\r\n## Who Are We?\r\n\r\nWe're a progressive, interracial, American couple that come from backgrounds the average person might consider a bit wild, but we think that gives us a bit of uniqueness and edge, and we hope that shows in our content. For our own safety in our professional lives, our early work will likely just be voice narration—at least until we can be sure that we create won't negatively impact our personal and profession lives. At least one of us is already quite easy to find online for reasons completely unrelated to any of the kind of content you'll see on here (props to anyone that recognizes me voice).\r\n\r\n## Our Content\r\n\r\n**Our content will primarily be YouTube video essays focused on American politics**, though we could certainly branch out from there. What's the point of having the status of an armchair authority if you don't exercise it by speaking on every subject you can, right?\r\n\r\nOn a more serious note, we hold ourselves to a high standard when it comes to what we release publicly. Long-form content will be thoroughly researched, edited, re-editing, scrapped at least once, and previewed to those we trust before it ever sees the light of the day.\r\n\r\nWe have plans on writing about our methods and tools, as well, at some point. That sort of info could end up as written pieces or as videos. We really don't know yet. We're figuring this all out as we go (I''m literally teaching myself to program as we go just to make sure this website gets made and functions). The same goes for video production.\r\n\r\nMusic in videos, when possible and appropriate, will also be done by yours truly.\r\n\r\nIf you can't tell, we like to do things ourselves when we can, likely to a fault.","src/content/page/author.mdx","0e54de7a873312cc"]
